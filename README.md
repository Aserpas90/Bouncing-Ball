# Bouncing-Ball

My first project within the MIT xPro Full Stack Course

While an entry level display of front end development, I am very proud of  this because of the fact that I had gone from never seeing code before to being able to design this in a couple of weeks.


This will always be a wonderful reminder of the earliest stage of my development education.
